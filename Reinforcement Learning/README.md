# Reinforcement Learning Exercises
This repository recollects some solved Reinforcement Learning Exercises that I've been doing from different sources. Some of them have been converted into articles.

## Articles
* [Stationary and non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-basics-stationary-and-non-stationary-multi-armed-bandit-problem-cfe06d33b815)

## Code files
**Tabular solutions with complete knowledge of the environment**
* [Gridworld policy evaluation](gridworld/gridworld_policy_evaluation.py) [2]
* [Jack's Rental Car problem](gridworld/jacks_rental.py) [2]
* [Gambler's problem](gridworld/gamblers_problem.py) [2]

**Tabular solutions with limited knowledge on the environment**
* [Stationary and non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem](multi-armed%20bandit/Multi-armed%20bandit.ipynb) [2]

**Frameworks**
* [Can collector game](can%20collector/can_collector_framework.py)
