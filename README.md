# Playgroud Exercises
This repository  presents a curated collection of notebooks and code files I have worked on while learning a wide range of data science subfields, such as Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, etc. Some of these are accompanied by a pdf report and/or article.

## Articles
* [Stationary and non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-basics-stationary-and-non-stationary-multi-armed-bandit-problem-cfe06d33b815)

## Frameworks
* [Can collector game](can%20collector/can_collector_framework.py)
